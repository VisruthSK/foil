# b3

NB: `b3` is currently experimental, the API may change without warning.

---

`b3` helps you compare two Git revisions, typically `main` and a branch, to understand how your changes affect performance. It is designed for CI but also works during local development. `b3` runs the revisions in pairs and uses a Bayesian bootstrap with a small regression to estimate the branch's effect, account for drift and run order, and report the uncertainty around the results.

## Usage

```sh
b3 --baseline main --candidate HEAD --repetitions 30 --output-dir benchmark/ -- Rscript benchmark.R
```

Run `b3 --help` for the full set of options.

## Output

Each run writes to `--output-dir`:

- `config.json`: run's parameters and resolved revisions.
- `benchmark.log`: one JSON line per individual run.
- `measurements.csv`: paired baseline/candidate timings.
- `posterior.csv`: Bayesian bootstrap draws.
- `report.txt`: human-readable summary.
